This is a very simple three.js demo with a checkered floor with randomly-scattered green cubes. You can walk around this scene with standard FPS controls (WASD, space to jump).

You can go [here](http://demos.andrewradev.com/green-cubes/) for a live demo. A recent Firefox or Chrome are recommended. Click on the canvas to have the game capture your cursor and go fullscreen.

Here's a screenshot:
